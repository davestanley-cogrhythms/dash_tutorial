This folder documents my progress through the Insight dash tutorial:
https://sites.google.com/insightdatascience.com/insightwiki19a/dev-setups/dash-tutorial

I went through "Getting started" exercises, which link to the following getting
started tutorials: https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started

I did all of the exercises, which correspond to files 1-6 in the getting_started
folder.


Next steps:
  Go back to here: https://sites.google.com/insightdatascience.com/insightwiki19a/dev-setups/dash-tutorial
  Scroll down to "NEXT STEPS"
  This is where I left off. (Callbacks would be next)
